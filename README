jcha - Java Class Histogram Analyser

jcha is a tool to analyse Java class histograms, focussed on histogram comparison.
It can aid in debugging memory leaks, or for finding dominators before issues arise.
Supported histogram formats are those from "jcmd pid GC.class_histogram".

It can run compare 2 or more histograms, and find correlations between classes.




Possible future enhancements.
