jcha - Java Class Histogram Analyser

ABOUT:
jcha is a tool to analyse Java class histograms, focussed on histogram comparison.
It can aid in debugging memory leaks, or for finding dominators before issues arise.
Supported histogram formats are those from "jcmd pid GC.class_histogram".

It can run compare 2 or more histograms, and find correlations between classes.
You can either use the command line tool or the JavaFX GUI applications.



BUILDING:
  mvn package

RUNNING
 ./jcha histogram1 histogram2
 ./jcha -h  # for showing help on all options like sorting
 
 ./jcha-gui histogram1 histogram2



Possible future enhancements.
 - Correlate class statistics to find common characteristics like "gowing about the same amount"
 - Select best matching classes for jcha-gui
 - Command lie option to preselect classes, for both jcha and jcha-gui
 - Using the classpath of the analysed application, find the culprit class causing a leak.
